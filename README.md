Weather Control Station and Door Access Control using LabVIEW 2014

Weather Station:
Here we used an actual temperature sensor connected to a fan to plot the temperature. We then controlled it back with the fan value. The fan ran and stopped when the minimum temperature was reached and started when the maximum temperature was reached. Other control options also available.

Door Access Control:
This uses a RFID based hardware connected to LabVIEW via Serial over USB to open and close a door. There are inbuilt passwords and security features to handle different events. Data logging also handled.
